# Breakout Two Shield
Arduino shield for the Baseline Arduino workshop.
  * 3.5 mm audio jacks in and out, with leads (and associated circuitry) to analog in pins for reading the audio into the arduino.
    * Note: Audio jacks are stereo, but signal chain is mono.
  * Analog Potentiometers read by the arduino as inputs
  * In series, two second order filters; one high pass, one low pass, with tunable digital resistors.
  * 2 Buttons (IEEE Logos)
  * Other used pins go out to headers
